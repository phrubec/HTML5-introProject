	<h2>
		About Wolf Cola
	</h2>
	
	<h3>
		History
	</h3>
	<p>
		Wolf Cola was founded in October 6, 2011. During the time, current president Frank Reynolds was also working with various other projects, so 
		not long after the start of the company's creation, Frank has employed his son, now Vice President, Dennis Reynolds to work towards expanding 
		the company.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Present
	</h3>
	<p>
		After the initial startup of the company, it only took a few years of extensive production and marketing until Wolf Cola became a recognized 
		premium refreshment within the city of Philadelphia, select cities throughout the United States, and has also made sales overseas. With the increase 
		in sales and public recognition, Wolf Cola has been expanding the brand with its two notable selections for Diet and Cherry alternatives.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Future
	</h3>
	<p>
		With such a fast paced rise, Wolf Cola hopes that the increase in population will note it down as one of the most recognizable cola company within a 
		national scale at first. Through overseas sales, the goal to be recognized on an international level also seems within reach.
