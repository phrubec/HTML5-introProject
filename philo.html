	<h2>
		Wolf Cola Company Beliefs:
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		Wolf Cola would like to note that, as a family business, listening to people's concerns should be the most important thing a premium soda company 
		can do. To provide a sense of togetherness through the most difficult moments of life, Wolf Cola would like to be a welcome addition and be willing 
		to stand strong through it. <br /><br />
		<span class="quote"> "The perfect cola for closure." </span><br />
		- Dennis Reynolds (Vice President) <br /><br />
		The slogan for the company was actually a quote from the Vice President during the funeral of his newborn nephew. This was a troubling time for the 
		company, as they just started up, but the family business were also aware that they were also brought more together through the company. Wolf Cola 
		everybody. <br /><br />
	</p>
	
	<h2>
		Public Concerns:
	</h2>
	<p>
		Wolf Cola would also like to state that they have no affiliation with any terrorist organization, and would like to strengthen their own ideals by 
		stating that 10% of the profits will be sent to charities in West Africa. Wolf Cola's philosophy is to address and act upon the people's concern's 
		first. <br /><br />
		<span class="quote"> "We are taking every step necessary to address all of your concerns. We at Wolf Cola hope to be part of your family's daily 
		refreshment for years to come." </span> <br />
		- Dennis Reynolds (Vice President)
